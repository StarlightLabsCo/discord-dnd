The air is thick with the smell of roasting meat and freshly brewed ale. You notice a group of dwarves huddled in the corner, clinking mugs together in a toast. Near the fire pit, a lone figure sits with a lute, strumming a slow, mournful melody. Behind the bar, a stout barkeep polishes a mug with a dirty rag, eyeing you with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.\n\nWhat would you like to do?"
